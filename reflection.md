###What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
By doing this challenge I got to see how padding differs from margin in relation to the objects' border. Padding deals with the inner spacing between the border and object and margin deals with the outer spacing of the object.

###What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned about clear: both; as a great way to keep objects in their intended positon. Sometimes when you float objects it affects other objects around them and it's very tricky!


###What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
It was all quite challenging! The easiest was setting the background-image, setting fonts, and footer links. Positioning the objects for the header was the most difficult.

###What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
This challenge was great insight into the work that it takes to build websites. Just overall, I'm more exposed to the process.
