          Version control records and stores changes to a project over time. There are many benefits to using version control such as ablity to revert back to a previous version of your work if a mistake has been made in an update, recover work in case of loss or failure, share your work with others, and compare different versions of your work.

          Git helps you keep track of changes in your work by using a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS), an automated process that keeps a copy of every change made to a file within a repository. Within the repository you will find the most current state of the code, date  of changes made, author of the changes, and a message that explains the change.

          GitHub is an online Git repository hosting service that can be connected to your local computer through the command line/terminal. On GitHub you can give your work a face and connect with other developers socially. It's a platform that enables code sharing and collaboration.
